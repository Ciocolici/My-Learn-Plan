# My Learn Plan

A simple application that allows you to add learning tasks for each day of the week. You can write notes for each day, and whenever you close the program, the notes are saved automatically. When you launch the program again, it will automatically load the notes saved previously. 

I created this program as an experiment, specifically my first experiment in C#'s WPF Application, to help me prepare for my exam.

*To launch the application, start "My Learn System.exe" located in "(...)\My-Learn-Plan\bin\Release\net8.0-windows"*
